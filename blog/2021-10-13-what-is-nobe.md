This article aims to explore current ways of developing applications and help you decide if Nobe fits your use case. It might help you decide on "Why Nobe?".

Many names for codebases serve as starting points - "Starter Kit," "Boilerplate," and others. NobeJS works as a starter kit, but the vanilla version doesn't come with any functionalities. Instead, it is an implementation of the PAHR Strategy in NodeJS + Fastify. 

**What is Nobe:**

- It has an opinionated way to implement API Endpoints
- It gives functions implementing PAHR out of the box (You can configure a different strategy)
- It provides a few helpers function to create "Stories" along with tests
- It comes with the setup of Jest and Knex
- A community around using and learning microservices and containerization.
- Reusable deployable prebuilt containerized images 
- Open-sourced solutions and codebases under MIT License

Over the years, we have developed many applications in Laravel, Nest, Nobe + Express, Serverless - Our goal has been to make our code a closer representation of the business domain. There are patterns like BDD and DDD that aim to solve, and you can implement using Nobe.

Every internet company wants its team to keep the business requirements/stories and the big picture while developing applications. And over time, everyone ends up forming a strategy on how a story is in code. But, of course, you might not have any plan either, and it's random. So we thought there should be a framework that lets you incorporate that "strategy" directly as a global standard for all the stories in the codebase.

And we don't see Nobe as just a framework but a community where there is much learning, developing Microservices, deploying containers. We believe "reusability" should be one of the core foundations for any developer and organization. Knowledge and work should be shared so that we don't end up in a cycle of developing the same pieces again and again. 

This practice is already there, where tons of libraries are there in repositories by developers worldwide. However, developing business-friendly production-level apps is a challenge, and we believe adopting a consistent, predictable practice will save us much time.

You can get started looking at any of our example repos or trying out an getting started tutorial. 

Happy Nobing!
